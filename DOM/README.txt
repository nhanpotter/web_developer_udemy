DOM: Document Object Model
- The browser will load the html and create Javascript Object Model. This will act as an interface to use Javascript

3 web design layers:
- Structure: HTML
- Design: CSS
- Behavior: JavaScript
We should seperate the 3 layers (make least overlap as possible)

"Spaghetti code" -> refer to code without object oriented

Transition
	Include -webkit-transition and -moz-transition because browser may not support transition
